			<p>Pandas are one of the most precious animals in the world.Theyeat bamboo.People all over the world like them very much. There used to be many pandas in China long ago. As the balance of nature was destroyed and the weather was getting warmer and warmer, pandas became less. But at present, the number of pandas is increasing year by year. There are now so many pandas that some are being sent to other countries so that people there can enjoy them. The biggest nature park for panda in China is in Sichuan. Scientists hope that one day they will have enough pandas to be set free and let them live in the wild again.</p>
